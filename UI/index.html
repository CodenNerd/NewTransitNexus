            <p>This is a new tech world. The Virtual reality device opens up another realm. Today, more than at any previous time, the success of an organization depends on its ability to acquire
              accurate and timely data about its operations, to manage this data effectively, and to use it to analyse and guide its activities.
              The current scenario in the board is that it is registering about 10000 students at Polytechnic level per year and hence the
              work load is a very huge. Also because the number of students enrolled in board has increased manifold just in last couple of
              years only, all the processes in the board are manual with very little intervention of IT and thus the work becomes much more
              tedious and tough and is prone to errors . This paradox drives the need for increasingly powerful and flexible data
              management systems. To get the most out of their large and complex datasets, users must have tools that simplify the tasks of
              managing the data and extracting useful information in a timely fashion. Otherwise, data can become a liability, with the cost
              of acquiring it and managing it far exceeding the value that is derived from it.
